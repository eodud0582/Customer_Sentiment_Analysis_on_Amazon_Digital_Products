# Leveraging NLP and Machine Learning to Understand Customer Sentiment
## A Study of Customer Reviews on Digital Products
---

This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to understand customer sentiments in digital product reviews. By analyzing customer feedback, I aim to provide actionable insights for businesses to improve their products and customer experiences.

## Key Features
- Sentiment classification (positive/negative)
- Analysis of product feature feedback
- Machine learning models for sentiment prediction

## Dataset

Source: Amazon Customer Review Dataset (2004)

Products Analyzed:
  - Digital Cameras
  - Cellular Phones
  - MP3 Players
  - DVD Players

## Methodology
I used various machine learning techniques to classify sentiments:
- Embedding methods: TF-IDF, BERT
- Classifiers: Logistic Regression, Ensemble Voting
- Performance Metric: Accuracy and Macro F1-score

## Key Findings

Best Model: BERT with Weighted Soft Voting Ensemble
- Accuracy: 87%
- Macro F1-score: 86%

Traditional methods like TF-IDF also showed strong performance

## Challenges
- Limited dataset size
- Computational resource constraints
- Capturing more nuanced sentiments

## Future Work
- Expand dataset from multiple sources
- Explore advanced NLP techniques
- Develop hybrid machine learning approaches

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, BERT, Seaborn, Matplotlib
