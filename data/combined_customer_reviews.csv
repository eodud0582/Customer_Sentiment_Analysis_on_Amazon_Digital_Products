"troubleshooting ad-2500 and ad-2600 no picture scrolling b/w . repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title . does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ? or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ? before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first . no picture : hopefully you still have the remote control . if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it . using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive . if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd . if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car ! picture scrolling in b/w : you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard . press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc . by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen . for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips . i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .

dvd player but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! 
dvd player it practically plays almost everything you give it . 
player,sound i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .

"incredibe price / performance . i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 . 
dvd player this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways . 
look,panel button layout,feature it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set . 
forward, rewind its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . 
video format it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well . 
price and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom . strengths are well listed by other reviewers . 
play, dvd-r what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) . 
dvd-r it sure does ! 
dvd-r that 's a rare and valuable feature . i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) ! 
audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable . 
forward at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo . 
remote control, mp3 filename weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size  . if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model . 
finish update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it !","[{'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'look', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'layout', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'feature', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'forward', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'rewind', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'format', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'price', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'play', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'r', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'r', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'r', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'output', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'forward', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'control', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'filename', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'finish', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Apex DVD,incredibe price performance owned 6 7 dvd player since 1998 dvd player far nicest one many way lookpanel button layoutfeature sleek looking good front panel button layout great feature set forward rewind fastforward rewind work much smoothly consistently model video format play alternate video format vcds svcds cvds well price amazoncom great price go wrong bought one den buy 2nd one bedroom strength well listed reviewer play dvdr got buy reviewer said would play dvdrs fill file e mp3s dvdr sure dvdr rare valuable feature dvd burner computer zillion mp3s lot nicer access 45 gb time dvdr 07 gb time cdr audio output another nice thing unit optical coax digital audio output though latter mentioned literature scanned buying saved buy expensive optical cable already coax cable forward doublespeed 2x forward speed still play mp3s sound pitchcorrected smooth twice fast wish would movie one rare cool feature forgo remote control mp3 filename weakness minor feel layout remote control soso nt show complete filename mp3s really long name must cycle every zoom setting 2x 3x 4x 12x etc getting back normal size bargain hunter want great feature set rockbottom price highly recommend model finish update finish mirror silver like

"i 've had no problems . 
apex the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . 
player i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it . 
heat it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation . 
smell it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time . 
freezing the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . "" this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue . the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend . 
player ( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . ) 
jpeg slideshow,mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . 
remote the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons . 
button i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way . 
zoom mode i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . 
zoom the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings . 
onscreen display having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying . i have not used the progressive scan feature . this model has come down in price since i purchased mine . while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase . any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support . 
player while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .","[{'feature': 'apex', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'heat', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'smell', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'freezing', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'slideshow', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'mpeg1', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'remote', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'button', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'mode', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'zoom', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'display', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Apex DVD,problem apex apex 2600 steady performer player bought mine december 2003 real problem heat tend run quite hot given lot room air circulation smell also seem strong new electronics smell time freezing thing experience problem player freezing playing able clear opening blowing canned air problem vanished first month assume temporary dust issue two main reason getting model range disk type played recommendation friend player owned two apex dvd player pleased jpeg slideshowmpeg1 fact model would play jpeg slideshows big plus visual artist discovered accident mentioned anywhere literature play mpeg1 file regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting remote remote okay fan remote tiny button button especially like commonly used button play pause stop larger conveniently placed true stand end also easy knock way zoom mode also nt like way displayed information way screen zoom mode zoom zoom go magnification nice always display zoom size onequarter way top screen interferes viewing setting onscreen display spent considerable time professional video gear find onscreen display annoying used progressive scan feature model come price since purchased mine seems like people trouble mine run well would recommend considering dvd player purchase possible problem weighed bangforthebuck factor along fact company like apex seldom good aftersale support player would like give 35 star instead 4 gave 4 run well time owned

use the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . 
picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .

"cool toy yep . 
camera this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it . 
picture just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . 
use whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together . + you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc. as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) . i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast . a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images . some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ). 
dial * main dial is not backlit . 
viewfinder * lens visible in optical viewfinder . ( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .

"canon g3 ? incredible camera i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras . a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models . following my research , i decided on the g3 .

viewfinder the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .

camera i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) . i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera . 
darn diopter adjustment dial the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .","[{'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'dial', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}]",Canon Camera,nt practice already love camera camera one full day say wonderful photo quality photo quality amazing know going fun feature figured feature already used digital camera know thing like symbol one people concentrate one screen time trouble paying attention little display panel top nt stop loving camera darn diopter adjustment dial reason rated four darn diopter adjustment dial small hard turn get accurate adjustment nt know diopter adjustment adjust focus viewfinder eyesight going much fun camera learn post accurate review
"excellent for the semi-serious amateur positives 
exposure control,auto setting 1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . 
metering option excellent range of metering options as well . 
spot metering it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
4mp 2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 
zoom 3 ) 4x zoom is nice 4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . 
focus 5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . 
focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . negatives 
size,weight 1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
design 2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )

software the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . 
lens cap,viewfinder the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .

camera this is a great camera for you ! 
control,auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos ! 
control i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus . 
photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers . warning - i did read the manual ! 
control but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located . 
dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .

"ok for a digital camera 
picture maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . 
price it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
camera sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . i do n't think i was asking too much . any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort . and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera . 
camera i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . i wanted it to shoot concerts as well . that meant even less light and just as much action . sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 . 
grain the grain was terrible . next time i set it at 100 and used the flash . 
flash photo,noise well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . 
photo when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . 
camera the camera was a marvel . getting the printer to help output them was another tale . overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do . for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital . you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost . then again a one time use camera may do just as well . if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .

"within its limitations i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias . i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move . what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses . i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient . hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations . 
g3 i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . 
lag time,flash the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr . at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available . 
depth what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus . now what about the flash problem ? 
flash relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . 
external flash hot shoe fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 . for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c . in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself . 
flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow . then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored . the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself . this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away . unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved . the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) . but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera . the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you . the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine . 
software now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! 
software the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information . maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces . i didnt wait to experiment . instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in . 
g3 what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . 
color without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! 
g3,software the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . 
software what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it . 
image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .

"great digital camera after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews . the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try . i 'm very glad i did . 
service the service from the supplier was exceptional . the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition . 
photo having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition -- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles . 
photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . 
automode,manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom . 
viewfinder about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler . but who cares ? i always shoot using the lcd panel .

"canon never ceases to amaze being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 . 
canon but canon never fails to amaze . some of the great gains over g2 -- 
raw format 1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 
battery life 2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . 
software 3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive . 
shape 4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . a big plus in my book . 5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments . 
light auto correction the light auto-correction is awesome . 
picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . 6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes . there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation . 7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view . i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera . ( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ). 
white offset 8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking . 9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep . personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors . 
g3 overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize . short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .

"the catch 
unresponsiveness the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture . no one told me , but i wanted to tell you . this is not the same thing as a film camera . and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs . they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet . most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera . but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw : 
delay it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . i am not talking milliseconds . picture this : your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment . when it arrives , you press the shutter release . splash ! the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot . perhaps there is a way around this delay . some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get . yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay . yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash . but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera . i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera . it focuses in a snap . dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board . 
delay canon 's g3 does it consistently . 
focus, shoot it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive . and so i must ask , what are cameras for ? what task do they perform ? cameras capture moments . they stop time . because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back . the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras . a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture . not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem . like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone . so buy the g3 . buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever . but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as  to stop the moment you choose . from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .

"the best 4mp out there 
4mp camera the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital . 
picture with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots . 
control,menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus . i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera . many before me have done that already . i agree with the positive reviews . but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .

"love it more and more i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it ! there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted . i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research . canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives . i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands . needless to say , the canon won , hands down . this camera performs like i can not believe ! 
performance i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode . 
camera this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !

"the last digital camera i 'll buy i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time . after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 . 
camera am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
camera i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy . forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer . i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual . 
menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera . i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged . 
battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging . i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures . 
optical zoom,viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom . 
viewfinder one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all . as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever . these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .

"boxy ? no -- gorgeous you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions . i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ? 
camera because this camera is beautiful . the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely . 
look the g3 looks like a work of art !

"very good choice in it 's price range this is my first digital camera . 
camera i am very pleased with it so far . i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time . this seemed like a really good compromise . i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 . based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal . it is not perfect though . here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far : it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera . 
viewfinder you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder . 
tiff format ( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format . that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw . to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power . 
lag it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? trips . ( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . ) for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop . 
import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop . i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .

"powerful product bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations . 
use,design in general it is easy to use and well laid out . for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor . 
use,control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly . 
feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography . 
auto mode in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again . the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses ! this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this . negative points : 
memory card the included memory card is too small . go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense . 
made it is made of plastic . for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience . this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure . 
lens the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . this is not a handbag camera . 
size while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets . 
lever the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile . 
flash flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost . the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography . 
strap the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble . good points : 
camera the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing . 
option canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out . 
learning learning how to use it will not take very long . 
image quality the image quality is excellent . messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results . unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough . 
function range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography . please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used . a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film . i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .","[{'feature': 'use', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'design', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'use', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'control', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'feature', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'mode', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'card', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'made', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'lens', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'lever', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'flash', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'strap', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'control', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'learning', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'function', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}]",Canon Camera,powerful product bought product month ago used variety situation usedesign general easy use well laid cool factor buff look feel like small plastic brick brick nt wow factor usecontrol make extremely easy use well laid control learned quickly feature g3 feature would want semipro pro slr good range manual option know something photography auto mode hand someone nt yield good result idiot program auto mode wife never used camera picked soon got hang fact nt like created delete try photo took better result got nikon slr range lens big plus shifting digital g3 large mobile screen help negative point memory card included memory card small go get 256meg card worth expense made made plastic used brass camera dropped picking camera like g3 unnerving experience mean unique model sure lens zoom lens unit feel fragile worth buying good camera bag going put carry round lot handbag camera size light easily go small handbag pocket lever function lever one switch capture view mode feel fragile flash flash builtin flash small camera get overilluminated main subject depth lost g3 shoe take powerful expensive canon flash allow bounce reflected flash photography strap strap horrible get way part camera need access afford camera afford get better strap elsewhere minor quibble good point camera functionality camera mindblowing option canon packed lot option control easy use logically laid learning learning use take long image quality image quality excellent messing around image photoshop supplied software package printing good printer yielded excellent result unless making poster g3 good enough function range function indicated something everyone point shoot power plus advanced function serious photography please note first digital camera owned used lot opinion relevant switching film extensive research chosing g3 nothing like picking one playing first

"this camera is closest to perfect than any otherdigicam 
camera this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel . beats that sony f717 ; its archrival . 
4mp resolution i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways . please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story . my story is based on personal usage . 
distortion yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture . moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon . the distortion is not a flaw . as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand . i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this . 
shot in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! 
picture,learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery . based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots . i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash . the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it . anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 . it 's a winner . 
picture quality i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind . my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com . they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's . that 's what i did and hopes this helps .","[{'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'resolution', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'distortion', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'shot', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'picture', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'curve', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Canon Camera,camera closest perfect otherdigicam camera camera closest perfect digicam 45 megapixel beat sony f717 archrival 4mp resolution glad canon decided keep 4mp resolution improved upon new technology fit resolution 4mp 2272x 1704 resol 19in flat monitor 1200x1024 resol anyways please go read dpreviewcom get complete story story based personal usage distortion yes corner lens barrel distortion nt like harm done since always use camea lcd screen see exactly going get viewfinder nt zoom zoom lens distortion go away canon know engineered way minimize parallax phenomenon lmost exactly ot picture moving viewfinder elsewhere camera remove lens distortion increase parallax phenomenon distortion flaw taking digital picture notice people including error compactflash result certain shot partially taken lost issue seems effect compactflash digicam brand nt heard diagnos fix shot term shot taken camera insanely great picturelearning curve picture fabulous short learning curve ton feature nt even gotten term important accessory got extra litium battery based used 1 full charge enough least 255 shot also got 512mb viking compact flash enough 255 shot full 4mp resolution max picture quality used 250 3lb subnotebook usb connection ton hard drive space long trip verify taken subnotebook also save buy extra compactflash compact flash delicate hate swap fear connetions camera cf bending lead cf erros losing anyways canon improved upon g2 g3 winner picture quality pleased picture quality durability snow car boat wind suggestion get lens protector help protect shooting lens lens coating wear many clean wipe getting 52 mm adapter uv lens filter lensmateonlinecom got best lens adapter g3better canon hope help

camera everything else about the camera is great .

"i love it more the longer i own it i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control . i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price . i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far . 
camera and so far , i 've been very pleased . there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures . 
lens,optical zoom the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . 
lcd the moveable lcd screen is great . you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself . 
remote the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before . 
hot shoe flash the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit : i chose the canon speedlite 420 . this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting . 
battery i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery . 
battery charging system the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery . 
manual i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear . you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do . negatives ? 
highlight i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . ( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . ) 
no-off button the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . 
body and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 . i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution . 
download i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files . i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images : i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly . at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough . if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software ! and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers . the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you . but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately . added 2-24 . 
camera i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it . i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting . it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings . if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper . i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker . especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations . i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) . very easy to use . i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too . 
camera,use,photo very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .","[{'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'lens', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'zoom', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'lcd', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'remote', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'flash', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'system', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'manual', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'highlight', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'button', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'body', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'download', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'use', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'photo', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Canon Camera,love longer using powershot s330 nearly year wanted upgrade 4 5 megapixel camera longer zoom adjustability hot shoe external flash remote control looked nikon coolpix 5700 canon g3 decided g3 due ergonomics much comfortable hold use price camera two week shot hundred picture far camera far pleased noticeable difference quality 4 megapixel image versus 2 megapixels s330 especially want crop enlarge picture lensoptical zoom larger lens g3 give better picture quality low light 4times optical zoom get much closer lcd moveable lcd screen great take picture camera held head way beside problem allowing position camera best shot without contorting remote tiny postagestamp sized remote unit wonderful trigger shutter also used zoom review picture also purchased good sturdy tripod combination new camera tripod remote control enabled take remarkable indoor naturallight portrait never would attempted hot shoe flash hot shoe flash attachment allowed buy use sophisticated flash unit chose canon speedlite 420 made greatest difference quality photograph builtin flash camera give flat photo redeye annoying shadow good addon flash unit bounced ceiling wall pleasing almostnatural lighting battery needed three battery keep going s330 battery g3 real powerhouse shot 300 photo goddaughter birthday party without switching backup battery battery charging system g3 different type battery charging system smaller canon camera battery need charged camera charging system also enables use camera plugged without running battery manual yet try using adjustment option shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustment etc control well thought manual relatively clear use camera right box automatic setting slowly get comfortable manual setting negative highlight bothered blownout highlight s330 g3 seems slightly better starting think may one weakness digital photography level nooff button onoff button feel somewhat flimsy awkward tiny little lockout button need depressed turn camera body body construction general quite bit plastic disappointment stainless steel heft s330 bought 512 mb card seems hold 400 photo highest resolution download worried 4 megapixel photo would download slowly difference working file 120 gb remote drive use store digital image imagine fill ibook internal memory pretty quickly time purchased camera also bought adobe photoshop elments 20 software praise highly enough investing camera level buy software said review s330 digital camera easier use apple computer bottom line serious digital photography bitten bug using digital pointandshoot may camera make sure buy tripod separate flash unit time see difference photo immediately added 224 camera camera two month even pleased wound buying gray card use time custom whitebalance setting help avoid problem color cast picture especially mixedlight setting nt gray card use plain white piece paper also discovered exposurebracket setting enables take three exposure one press shutter first cameradetermined exposure one lighter one darker especially useful portrait difficulttometer situation buy telephoto lens required extension easy use probably also get wideangle camerausephoto comfortable camera easy use best digital photo going get price
"best non-slr digital camera under 5 megapixels 
g3 i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised . after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) . it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more . this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features . it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .

"the best so far the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera . 
optic canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better . 
digital camera simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point . the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage . for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card . 
battery life the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen . 
look the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . 
camera even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .","[{'feature': 'optic', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'look', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Canon Camera,best far canon g3 improves almost way g1 g2 fact beat nikon coolpix 5000 performance picture quality battery life amazing 5000 5 megapixel camera canon 4 megapixel camera optic canon optic better believe processing algorithm also better digital camera simply canon g3 best digital camera today price point canon allows change lens accepts ibm microdrive type ii compact flash 1 gigabyte storage fine resolution setting maximum close add 1000 image 1 gig card battery life battery life camera twice nikon 5000 better anything else seen look minor nit camera fairly boxy looking need wrist strap instead neck strap bit slow shot camera even shortcoming still think best digital camera available 1200

"a quick update to the new zen nx ? this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .

"get this player ! before i decided to get this player , i did my research . i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player . 
deal i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money . 
wma file another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it . that takes up half the space of mp3 's . that 's important because i have a lot of music . 
software the software is great . you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories . 
software transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy . 
battery life even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good . 
accessory only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet . 
remote i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .

sound the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s . 
navigation navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well . 
weight at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod . 
battery,leather case the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) . i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .

"an ipod killer : this thing kicks mighty apple butt ! i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars . 
player it 's worth it . i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else . after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for . 
battery life,price my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both . this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time . the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway ! 
sound, headphone the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones . you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans. 
control the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! 
scroll wheel the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad . 
size it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to . 
screen the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue . 
firewire it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves . ( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however ) 
leather pouch the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices . 
battery,construction,size,weight other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod . ( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? ) i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models . since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make . 
size,sound,price overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !

"the interfacing software is unacceptably bad . one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored . 
software the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software . on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers . despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually . 
software the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use . with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop . i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program . 
player the player itself has all sorts of problems . 
face plate the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so . 
file transfer the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . 
scroll the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others . 
scroll depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive . 
scroll the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . 
sound on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured . 
audio i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs . 
player overall , a very disappointing product . 
setup,interface the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .

price when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat . if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. . this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds . i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .

"replaceable battery lets zennx keep running and running . 
battery zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod . all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) . apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) . 
battery the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance . 
earphone,software deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ). notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx . 
screen,switch the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky . zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ). choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery . zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery . update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory . lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage . still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .","[{'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'earphone', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'screen', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'switch', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,replaceable battery let zennx keep running running battery zennx replaceable battery deciding factor purchase zennx ipod rechargeable battery lose holding power time around 2 year apple solution pay apple another 400 new ipod less paltry discount battery zennx keep running price replacement battery like batterypowered appliance earphonesoftware deficiency zennx easily overcome 3rdparty earphone 20 software 25 notmad red chair software explorerbased program enables simple draganddrop transfer music file pc zennx screenswitch bluescreen display zennx xtra model improvement toggle switch still tricky zennx capacity price ratio 30g model 10gig trump ipod 30g model 14gig choosing zennx nobrainer factoring cost new 400 ipod every year versus 50 cost replacing zennx rechargeable battery zennx hopefully gain market share prompt arrogant apple lower price enable consumer replace battery update apple recently announced 107 replace battery ipod shipped factory lithium ion rechargeable battery good 300500 rechargings battery lifespan vary according usage still apple continues squeeze dollar consumer designing battery replaceable
"terrific mp3 player , great price . 
nomad i love my new nomad , its great ! now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home . 
look this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod . 
price for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison . 
software the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds . 
case the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) . 
headphone, sound on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof ! if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .

"impressed ! i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit . i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive . for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player . i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is "" trendy "" to have that player . this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type . after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. . i will just say this : i will never go back to my archos again ! ! 
set up so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos . stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing . 
nomad explorer just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc. 
player,look not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy . 
design very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has . 
leather case the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly . 
button all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand . 
sound quality the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with . 
sound option lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options . 
navigation navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch . 
navigation also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player . it was impossible to do so before . 
screen saver oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^ 
file limit another plus in my book , no file limits ! i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want . 
playlist i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up . 
storage i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder . now i can transport files to friends house with ease . when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load . after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price ! 
player i really have no complaints over this unit . 
player i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player . in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .","[{'feature': 'up', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'explorer', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'look', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'design', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'case', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'button', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'option', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'navigation', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'navigation', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'saver', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'limit', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'playlist', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'storage', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Creative MP3,impressed sold archos 20gb jukebox recorder satisfied slow loading difficult navigation mention froze quite bit search new item take place new mp3 player harddrive early christmas gift got zen xtra 40 gb player refused go ipod going spend money apple name trendy player closest alternative best buy type receiving zen xtra 40gb mp3 player say never go back archos set easy set problem archos stayed night trying figure thing nomad explorer easily drag drop file nomad explorer easily alter id tag sort music according liking artist song title genre etc playerlook functional run super smooth fast also eye candy design sleek stylish well screen option visuals leather case leather case come pretty nice similar pda style case hold protect perfectly button button neccessary lil gadget side player nice holding palm hand sound quality sound quality also nice hooked sony headphone instead factory earbuds come sound option lot sound option equalizer almost like winamp option navigation navigation smooth finding file cinch navigation also navigating playing music plus unlike previous player impossible screen saver oh screen saver feature pretty sweet _ file limit another plus book file limit limited 999 file playlist archos o many want playlist 2000 file playlist moment random nice job mixing storage quite happy 10 gig music stored baby well gig medium file data folder transport file friend house ease plugged nt lag computer like archos unless massive transfer data one load playing little device nt know would look ipod space cost 500 got mine little half price player really complaint unit player really recommend anyone need new player fact boyfriend going invest one sucker well realizes best choice current archos ipod eyeing

"not ipod competition . i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) . you 're talking totally different hardware . all of the zens use a standard notebook drive . this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ). the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) . the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 . i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod . the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 . that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range . i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices . advertising pays off i guess .. . i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player . 
zen i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class . my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ). i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .","[{'feature': 'zen', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Creative MP3,ipod competition think whole zen line fairly innovative reasonably priced really appropriate compare pricing zen line ipod although ipod still way priced talking totally different hardware zen use standard notebook drive put zen line player like rca jukebox whole line archos player newer one bit better original archos jukebox popped drive 20 gig jukebox recorder put 60 gig drive use exclusively powered portable usb 20 drive ipod us smaller expensive drive 18 device competing ipod iriver ihp 120 rio karma philip hdd100 point new rio karma 280 reviewed readily good better area ipod 20 gig ipod still go 400 huge difference especially price range believe people continue pay price advertising pay guess doubt anyone ever seen add commercial mp3 player zen gave zen 5 star excellent class really appropriate rate based player different class personal favorite karma currently karma zen usb 20 philip hdd100 upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder guess often see ipodders bashing every player often knowing anything whole spent 120 something better feel better thing
"ipod vs nomad zen xtra i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player . after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments : 
transfer transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 . 
transfer it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error . having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered . 
scroll wheel scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling . 
size size - bigger than the ipod 
software software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut . after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod . song transfers were not an issue . i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire . the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did . the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small . the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this . 
sound quality sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features . i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase . granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it . itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .","[{'feature': 'transfer', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'transfer', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'wheel', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}]",Creative MP3,ipod v nomad zen xtra originally purchase 30 gb nomad zen xtra portable mp3 player fiddling around notice dissapointments transfer transfering could get song completely transfer via usb 11 20 transfer would transfer 30 song come error 4000 mp3s never got 500 transfered scroll wheel scroll button scroll wheel nice idea keep less clutter button would sometimes get stuck keep scrolling size size bigger ipod software software music match jukebox nt greatest search funtion nt fast even accessing hotkey shortcut went transer issue returned zen xtra purchased 40 gig ipod song transfer issue transfered 16 gig 15 minute without error via firewire navigion little quirky still operates better zen ipod also attractable piece lightweight small casing scratch little easy glove case work great protect sound quality sound quality two zen sound adjustment normal eax feature chose keep ipod happy purchase granted little zen well worth itunes versatile program nt issue ipod

"a good product . 
size,weight,look,folder structure first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture . the pro ... 
price way less expensive than the ipod . my opinions : personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. . 
interface i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. . it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list . meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list . 
folder structure the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another . 
chinese name and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title .. and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese .. if it had the same number of "" ? "" s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of "" ? "" s. . . buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) . i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand . 
transfer not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless . once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel . and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done . in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ). so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about . of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too . you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc. the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since . did i mention i 've already dropped it once ? that was n't pretty . there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close . hehe , my bad . that 's all for now .","[{'feature': 'size', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'weight', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'look', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'structure', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'price', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'interface', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'structure', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'name', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'transfer', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,good product sizeweightlookfolder structure first con tad bulky asthetic looking player nt support folder stucture pro price way less expensive ipod opinion personally nt understand complaint interface interface find pretty easy use unlike remote interface audigy 2 nx pc actually give option clear previous playlist want play another list meaning nt manually clear list load new list folder structure con nt really big deal except one con annoy way store file folder structure based title song many song seperated folder pc title change title make sure nt might another chinese name man work put chinese song player actual chinese name song title since current language selection english even though think menu support chinese track info saw even though song different name chinese number would ask want overwrite another song number buyer beware sort song adjust title accordingly maybe applies player nomad nt know would still bought drive even knew issue beforehand transfer counting time spent editing song suppose done anyway pc transfer pretty painless start sending file continue done hit song title another song point skip skip replace replace cancel go chose one option nt need anything done two transfer batch first english song foreign language nt come error aside duplicate name mentioned nt know previous review could nt 30 song talking course unlike person mention upgraded firmware 123 00 transfer file upgrade without problem update firmware upgrading driver decide need newer driver pc mediasource flaky crashing explorer twice within first hour crash nt require reboot another reboot nt crashed since mention already dropped nt pretty dent upperbackright lowerbackright corner obvious unless close hehe bad
"so far , it 's sweet . 
xtra bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent . 
storage i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it . i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing . i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit . 
interface,software both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice . besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either . 
transfer ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) . 
case people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection . 
case it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to . 
sound quality,look,screen, battery the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) . 
option you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) . i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer ! 
button the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing . 
button my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go . not an urgent issue , as it still works .. . 
button all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well . i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road . 
support but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. . we 'll see if i need them to .

"excellent product . 
player i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it . my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time .. just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together . the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go . so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift . 
setup, transfer the setup and transfer process was cake for me . i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player . 
transfer i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem . 
explorer the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again . it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened . that 's probably a bad thing . 
player the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well . it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors . 
player now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems . 
screen the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it . i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there . 
eax mode the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides . 
jog dial the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it . the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model . 
mp3 player all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player . i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy . highly recommended !","[{'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'transfer', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'transfer', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'explorer', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'screen', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'mode', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'dial', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Creative MP3,excellent product player received 40gb zen xtra yesterday extremely pleased brother bought ipod past summer dad bought original zen around time spent couple week rv together ipod neat piece machinery screwing around think zen product way go requested received zen xtra christmas gift setup transfer setup transfer process cake used explorer program move song player transfer put little work renaming duplicate file name get music zen xtra nt big problem explorer explorer program shut couple time renaming title changing genre nt reboot computer anything open explorer long since program shut window hardly even noticed happened probably bad thing player unit lock time hit reset button fairly painless process well always finished process something nt cause file error player music nt problem screen screen large bright info need need nt tried setting playlist yet comment problem eax mode eax mode keep volume level song come handy take holiday plane ride jog dial little jog dial seems weak quirky hope nt figure way break dial original zen perfect wish model mp3 player though happy new mp3 player admit ipod money burn money much better buy highly recommended
"fantasic product . 
nomad i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! 
installation i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver . this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver . 
software i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy . if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button . 
playlist ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier . 
mediasource i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer . just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done ! 
playback quality being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable . i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds . 
sound when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! 
sound quality the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior . 
nomad actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated . 
finding finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy . i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd . 
screen the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .

"good value . 
player just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date . 
size nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something . 
sound quality all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) . 
eax the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative . 
player i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment . dislikes 
control - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones . 
fly wheel the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use . 
button the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
software - included creative software is pretty poor . red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software . note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it likes

"depressingly poor quality . after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 . the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever . i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" . at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air . 
play i tried to play the song three times , with no success . 
play it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk . well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work . i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page . needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product . 
software had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .","[{'feature': 'play', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'play', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}]",Creative MP3,depressingly poor quality receiving box amazon proceeded charging unit specified 4 hour installed software connected unit pc via usb 20 pc quickly picked attempted install software failed creative chose follow microsoft standard whatever installed software manually instead click past 5 window please register u spam inbox time decided turn player much surprise come quite little library classical music one childhood favorite bach air play tried play song three time success play would either play song skip wildly matter unit resting desk well maybe particular song corrupt tried upload four attempt one unit locked required reboot managed upload album albeit surprisingly fast however attempting create playlist newly uploaded song nomad froze refused work made additional five attempt creating playlist packing unit heading amazon product return page needless say would nt recommend anyone purchasing product software strange noise obvious defect would accepted replacement clearly defective inferior operating system one intend waiting patch

"good player , but this technology is not yet great . i received this as a gift . 
software i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred . 
software however , the creative software is not real intuitive . 
software the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest . 
rename if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly . you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player . 
transfer transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 . 
sound it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds . 
earbud i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players . 
storage i love the storage in this thing . i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive . i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know . this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd . now my dissapointments . the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd . the warranty is 90 days . 
warranty this is ridiculous . to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year . buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) . 
scroll wheel the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks . 
scroll wheel seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection . 
interface the interface used could be better designed . 
interface it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers . 
case and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control . 
case it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it . the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it . 
control the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel . there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it . 
player despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. . 
lock up however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times . i have had it lock up after a transfer of music . the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery . also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call . left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over . could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen . again had to remove the battery . there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details . 
firmware quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time . there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before . i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error . now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one . i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology . and we all know about the rush to market on new products . i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit . while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .

"another electronics fan . summary 
unit overall i like the unit . 
player i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) . if it were not for that i would have given it 4 . pros : 
price 1 ) price / gb of storage 
storage 2 ) storage capacity 
battery 3 ) user replaceable battery cons : 
construction 1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ) 
scroll 2 ) scroll button / switch 
case 3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing . features that would have been nice : 1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this . 2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo . they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck . but who wants the wires involved . a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer . i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature . details : do n't drop this unit : i 've had the player for about a month now . 
player overall i like it . as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days . i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke . i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) . i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement . if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you . i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement . updating the unit 's firmware : when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website . the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions . i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation . storage : 
storage the storage capacity is great . i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb . i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet . i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place . for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels . typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps. the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size . if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps . you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player . if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ). price : 
price the price compared to the ipod is great . 
price,battery price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad . one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes . i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format . it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad . i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes . 
itunes but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes . scroll bar : 
scroll the scroll bar is a bit of a pain . sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items . it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice . software : 
software i 've had no problems with the software . 
software i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) . the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to . my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ). through the software you can classify songs in genres . 
software this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem . 
software the software comes with plenty of defaults genres . you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications . you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later . this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass . in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player . this is pretty cool . sound :

"it is ok , but .. . i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago . it was not my first choice . i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra . 
storage one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) . 
price,feature for the price and features it is really good . one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes . sure enough there is no such ability . not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear . 
navigation in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . 
navigation you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division . creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features . 
software the software , which comes with player is not good at all . 
nomad explorer i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad . notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product . transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other . often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables . artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory . after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required . the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .","[{'feature': 'storage', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'price', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'feature', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'navigation', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'navigation', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'explorer', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,ok got zen xtra little bit week ago first choice done lot research decided buy nomad zen xtra storage one good thing 40 gb disk space well 38 gb reality pricefeature price feature really good one thing buying player called creative tech support asked navigate folder beside artist album answer yes sure enough ability sure customer rep know product exactly still new give anser user would like hear navigation case navigation artist album ok however miss ability navigate folder navigation even navigate genre artist album since genre get track genre division creative talking updating via firmware however following descussion group nomad player look like creative represents mostly bug fix firmware update much new feature software software come player good nomad explorer managed make creative nomad explorer work installing trying make working 30 minute went bought notmad notmad worked right away install would like see product transfer file easy using notmad however would great nomad supported folder like iriver rca lyra often fill need better organization library enought variable artist album genre mp3 tag supported buy player 100 artist would good another subcategory player 4060 gb hard drive better organization required bottom line still watch progress iriver hdd player produce 40 gb player sell nomad buy iriver

sound,battery life,price the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent . the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use . 
style,size,control the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to . 
player so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing . i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order . is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ? i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering . thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !","[{'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'sound', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'price', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'style', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'control', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,creative thinking player purchased player say love soundbattery lifeprice sound excellent battery life excellent fact battery replacable excellent finally price 200 cheaper 40gb ipod excellent thing ipod nomad style size ease use stylesizecontrol nomad ugly big comfortably fit pocket heavy control hard get used player far complaint recommend anyone want quality appearance also anyone want harddrive based mp3 player want pay next nothing one question add track nomad via nomad explorer automatically put alphebetical order rather album order possible fix notmad explorer red chair software would like album order live album wondering thank much go get nomad

"perfect purchase . 
this item i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards . 
price naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable . 
value compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops . - price : see above . 
sound quality - sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company . 
use - the unit is easy to use and intuitive . it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls . 
uploading - uploading music is quick and easy . 
software although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent . i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! ) btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization . 
player,button - the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't . 
scroll as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible . structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you . 
screen the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool . 
feature there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization . 
battery - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily . ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement . 
battery life also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy . 
equipment - equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for . 
case the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) . 
headphone the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead . conclusion : 
player this player is an ideal purchase . there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features . i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .","[{'feature': 'item', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'price', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'value', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'use', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'uploading', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'button', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'scroll', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'screen', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'feature', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'equipment', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'case', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'headphone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Creative MP3,perfect purchase item received item christmas met exceeded standard price naturally quite bit review purchasing recomend wwwnomadnessnet pricewise zen unbeatable value compared leading hdd mp3 player value per gb top price see sound quality sound quality excellent everything would expect company use unit easy use intuitive took 5 minute mastered control uploading uploading music quick easy software although supplied software annoying time whole excellent uploaded 3000 song minimal difficulty fast btw sure mp3 tag labled correctly ensure great organization playerbutton unit well structured button need none nt scroll often mentioned scroll tab average however difficult use horrible structurally everything secure wo nt fall apart screen screen large defined easy read silver unit naturally cool feature lot interesting feature included eax customization battery replacable battery great since eventually wear lithium battery able buy another easily ipod user send back pay 100 replacement battery life also nomad 14 hour battery life versus 8 handy equipment equipment included average nt big deal since thats buying case case strong stylish unfortunately lack window big deal headphone headphone earbuds average use regular pair instead conclusion player player ideal purchase nt need get detail remember rock price sound ease use feature would recogmend player anyone know dissapointed

"awesome . 
zx i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review . first there 's the unit itself . 
size it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx . 
sound quality the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so . 
lcd the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did . 
scroll wheel the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate . 
sound the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product . 
eax the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle . 
enviromental audio the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . ) 
signal to noise ratio the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods . 
software the software has n't been a hassle for me at all . i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes . my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence . the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . ) 
price lastly , the price is fantastic : i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 . for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves . if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .","[{'feature': 'zx', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'lcd', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'wheel', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'sound', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'eax', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'audio', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'ratio', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'price', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Creative MP3,awesome zx pleased zx quick review first unit size small overall bigger ipod keep mind different less expensive necessarily inferior technology used zx sound quality zx boast superior sound quality ipod however compromise bit unit size lcd lcd larger previous model nx bright blue backlight illuminates screen successfully nx green backlight scroll wheel scroll wheel easy use work great however many complained wheel cumbersome difficult operate sound sound excellent one would suspect creative product eax included eax support useful time especially listen variety genre adjust equalizer big hassle enviromental audio environmental audio however almost completely useless made song sound worse without encode song 192256 kbps without variable bit rate signal noise ratio signal noise ratio ratio detectable useful data unusable garbage say radio wave larger stn ratio better nice high 98 decibles noted apple refuse release stn ratio ipod software software nt hassle ignored instruction booklet product figured organize separate playlist within minute sister able figure well average computer competence less computersaavy might find apple software bit friendlier though use friend house lot price lastly price fantastic spent 269 30gb zx compared 299 10gb ipod also expensive iriver ihp120 prospective buyer would warn following 1 purchase better pair headphone soon possible earbuds sound terrible terribly uncomfortable applies earbuds general 2 make sure mp3s id3 tag loaded playlist automatically sort want great sound quality nt want spend arm leg pergigabyte nt mind something iconoclast among many ipod user willing sacrifice cubic centimeter personal space large discount would suggest zen xtra
"it 's pretty good . read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! ! ( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) . and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need . eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures ) 
software i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems . transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds . it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds . 
usb 2.0 usb 2.0 - very fast 
earbud yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them . 
sound but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers . 
recharger and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ). 
look,size,weight it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light . 
scroll the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it . 
player i am very pleased so far . i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ). so far so good , no problems , no conversions . 
use very simple to use . the reason it does not get 5 stars 
battery 1 ) a spare battery would have been great .

sound excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox . there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled . 
transfer transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad . i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software . however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players . you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection . this would have been much easier . the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk . 
transfer i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer . this almost made it worth the price alone . i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's . 
storage huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing . 30gb is more than enough for most people . 
transfer having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers . it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file . it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs . cons : 
navigation navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs . this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't . it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system . you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it . whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags. 
fm receiver fm receiver - it has none . i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations . that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether . 
construction cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners . 
feel the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive . i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet . 
feel as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable . the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable . i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to . this is not a player you can take jogging . 
play the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd . you have to add them to the playing list . i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next . you have to add all the songs to a play list . there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet . 
software software - the software is crap . 
rip cd i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of . 
software otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward . like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it . 
instruction even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet . 
line out jack no line out jack - as i said , there is none . the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack . so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack . 
line out jack it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack . 
control controls are a bit awkward . the controls definately took some getting used to . 
control it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman . when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was . a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included . i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it . 
headphone crappy headphones . 
earbud the included earbuds were uncomfortable . i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones . 
navigation difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate . 
navigation it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly . 
navigation i think this is it 's biggest flaw . i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes . 
control up , down , left , and right would have given me better control . 
scroll wheel if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it . case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case . 
case it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack . that way i could keep it in the case all the time . 
case as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand . you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though . 
player overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it . 
sound, price, player i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .","[{'feature': 'quality',

"good for the money , but software is awful . after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one . 
price for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price . a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing . i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation . 
button,interface the buttons and interface are very easy to use . 
click buttons, display simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use . 
software but the major problem i had was with the software . you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them . 
instruction the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple . 
sync the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful . 
transfer i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused . i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player . well that was not a simple task . i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer . i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate . buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .","[{'feature': 'price', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'button', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'interface', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'buttons', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'display', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'instruction', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'sync', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'transfer', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,good money software awful looking multiple large mp3 player decided get one price price size feature beat price 10 gb ipod much heard multiple source ipod loud heard hard drive everytime spin access file antyhing think reson creative larger sound dampening protection whihc plus speculation buttoninterface button interface easy use click button display simple click button back button volume display easy read access use software major problem software able simply import file rather go multiple step find instruction instruction come nt explain make thing simple sync quick sync nt good becuase either need configured properly nt useful transfer tried make sense file transfer program got confused tried take cd simply rip onto hard drive transfer player well simple task ended suing window player make mp3 actually wma file using probram transfer think lack mp3 player able run without special software also downer becuase make cumbersome people less computer illiterate buy storage price avoid know nothing computer

"this thing roxxorz . i purchased this player last week . i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on . i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway . 
product i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product . 
software the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine . 
headphone the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity . 
battery life the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .

player i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box . 
product all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product . if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .

"it does n't get any better than this . 
player before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there . 
software many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me . 
cd rip the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive . 
software the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple . 
control the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual . 
player,sound the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium . 
battery the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files . 
playlist playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .

"difficult to manage large library . i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design . 
player it is an extremely cool gizmo . in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it . so what 's the problem ? i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device . i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 . i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me . the reasons below will be true for any product in this category . here 's why : 1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office . i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation . 2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . ) 3 . it 's a hazard in the car . 
navigation,scroll the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving . ( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a . 
playlist creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked . the bottom line : if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk . sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks . one major complaint : 
sound quality my only significant complaint is sound quality . 
eax the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . this did not give me enough control . i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter . 
sound quality i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost .

product well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket . 
product well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .

"in a word ... amazing i got this for christmas . i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ; it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. . what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy . 
price, player not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have . anyway , on with the review . so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life . 
battery life it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ). software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining . once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers . from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ). 
id3 tag my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them . if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do . 
transfer oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy . the player : it 's silver . 
weight a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine . people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) . 
scroll wheel it 's easy . 
button the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate . 
backlight the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see . 
eax my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature . you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ). 
eax its really cool . 
sound quality sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) . 
song speed you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too . 
earbud but the earbuds suck ! buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out . for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones . a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it . oh ... one more thing . 
case i forgot , the case does n't fit . 
case my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great . so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that . so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden . 
storage also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy . hope i helped !","[{'feature': 'price', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'tag', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'transfer', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'weight', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'wheel', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'button', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'backlight', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'eax', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'eax', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'speed', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'earbud', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'case', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'case', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'storage', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,word amazing got christmas going get 10gb ipod looking 10 day warranty ipod wwwipodsdirtysecretcom battery last 18 month cost like 200 dollar replace mail get battery replaced like 99 big improvement lol fact lot people problem ipod window computer realized much better buy price player affordable better player window anyway review far since christmas cant tell much battery life battery life hasnt gone second notch charge mine whenever home using battery life seems fine far software people complain software please stop complaining hook thing computer via usb cable machine instantly recognizes fact installs driver transfer file computer mp3 player help medium sniffer read manual id3 tag complaint would need id3 tag take mp3 file nt copying cd window medium really simple give song id3 tag thats transfer oh file transfer fast easy player silver weight little weighty 9 ounce biggie otherwise fine people complain scroll wheel big deal though little annoying time scroll wheel easy button button easy use easy navigate backlight big backlight make thing easy see writing big enough people see eax favorite thing nomad eax feature customize bass etc like usual also customize sound player like would sound concert hall jazz club etc eax really cool sound quality sound quality amazing expecting worse really good especially file good sound quality song speed also slow song speed cool earbud earbuds suck buy new one asap every time move face something pop 250 dollar player could thrown nice headphone remote would cool let push oh one thing case forgot case nt fit case case doesnt close maybe mine faulty case isnt great far player froze started pushing button loaded since hard drive based expect stick pin something small reset button golden storage also store data plus people want buy ipod say ipod nt bother much better buy hope helped
"simply doesnt shine . i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. . what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. . based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. . but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. . now we come to the zen xtra .. . 
player hardware first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. . 
sound,size the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. . 
software what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software . not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software . first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . . 
bookmark bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .

"excellent product with a few minor problems . i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive . over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive . many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend . 
price while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player . also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ). 
nomad i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it . 
weight,battery life it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life . 
storage capacity the storage capacity is great for me -- i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free . 
control the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price . 
load loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well . i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead . my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer . this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work . if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly . i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker . 
tag,software my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks . while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd . the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance . for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock . perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock . you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it . a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names . this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad . again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you . 
tag other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system . if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second . this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi . i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately . the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing . 
software also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order . 
playlist finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it . you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately . you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist . these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them . had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner . also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue . 
product the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product . apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .","[{'feature': 'price', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'nomad', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'weight', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'capacity', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'control', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'load', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'tag', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'tag', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'playlist', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'product', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Creative MP3,excellent product minor problem became interested getting mp3 player got new work computer office bar addition nonwork software nt care load cd onto hard drive time loaded hundred cd onto computer idea carrying around music became attractive many people recommended ipod borrowed one friend price ease use impressive put price 130 paid amazon player also need send ipod replace battery die nomad nomad jukebox three week happy weightbattery life slightly heavier ipod longer battery life storage capacity storage capacity great large huge cd collection loaded everything want listen still 13 gigabyte free control control somewhat harder use ipod gotten use even beginning think would justify huge difference price load loading cd somewhat timeconsuming think would ipod well never loaded cd home computer using work computer instead office would let put software work computer meant take cd fairly short period time done year work music home computer transfer would accomplished quickly older computer running window 98 se something recent would find process even quicker tagsoftware reservation product concern tagging process way interacts software load disc go internet cite insertion name cd track listing process accurate track name unlike window reliance amg frequently get track listing order result odd cd classified number genre multidisk set get separate classification different disk artist performance example jimi hendrix 2 cd live fillmore east one cd classifed classic rock psychidelic rock perhaps weirdest one bruce springsteen cd track set classified goth rock change need paying attention information downloaded copy somewhat troublesome problem internet site sometimes give different disc set slightly different name cause disc show together looking nomad change harder spot minor variation title nt title disk front tag tagging problem result think nomad operating system two track exactly name one disk copy give option skipping second overwriting first second rarely problem kind popular music troublesome classical music track identified tempo also happen recording jazz set number outtake song without numbering separately way fix rename track adding number end track listing software also understand software ignore list cd alphabetical order playlist finally making playlist computer complicated track listed individually organized cd listed organized alphabetical order word locate track using software computer add playlist must know name cd appears find track locating location unlisted cd looking track appear nt problem make playlist nomad cd listed separately need computer however want add track playlist minor problem list save anyone else trouble discovering hurry load cd would spotted sooner also already loaded tagged cd home computer would issue product bottom line happy product apple ipod dominant wonder whether price differential mean 3 4 year market share drop significantly

"zen versus ipod . i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) . while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better . software : 
software a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes . 
sync first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer . the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player . 
shuttle the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) . 
sync second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer . since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod . if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone ! 
player the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player . 
software third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer . 
cd burner only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs . if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 . itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy . 
creative for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages . player controls : here 's where the ipod drives me nuts . the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally . if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in . the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player . 
scroll zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player . 
remove it also lets you remove songs from the play order . 
delete if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order . you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod . lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself . while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc. none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent . again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional . i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines . win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs . with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it . if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen . 
zen its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.","[{'feature': 'software', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'sync', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'shuttle', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'sync', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'burner', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'creative', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'scroll', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'remove', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'delete', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'zen', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Creative MP3,zen versus ipod got 40gb ipod replace zen 20gb model ipod form factor much nicer zen better software software lot people complain creative software actually find creative mediasource organizer strength itunes sync first zen let sync one computer ipod one way machine computer player shuttle zen outstanding way shuttle music source ipod except cumbersome workaround using ipod hard drive instead player sync second automatic sync creative let review song begin transfer since ipod lack review feature autosync allows oneway transfer first time connected ipod laptop wiped 20gb music transferred desktop ipod hard drive computer fail better music backed somewhere gone player zen serf backup device well player software third creative software allows keep two window open look content player computer cd burner thing missing creative cd burner lastly ipod itunes play wma formatted song lot prepared convert mp3 itunes apple famous make software work less computer saavy creative u like tinker think creative offer advantage player control ipod drive nut player control easy hit accidentally happen push wrong button wipe order song put ipod also let see coming next player scroll zen allows scroll song list selected player remove also let remove song play order delete bring album absolutely hate track zen allow delete playing order skip next track hated song come ipod lastly manage anything ipod create temporary playlist store permanently delete song search easily etc none feature available ipod 1way transfer make change ipod premanent ipod beautiful thing look touch player control less functional think ipod versus zen typifies difference apple win machine win software little cranky much easier customize need apple get good product get way apple want might get 40gb zen zen ability serve backup music collection huge plus

"review for folks new to mp3s . i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around . here 's a basic run-down from what i learned : flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them . the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact . that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size . tiny ! mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory . i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory . ( 1 gb = 1,000 mb ) hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) . cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around . that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory . just be aware of it . this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players . a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more . it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive . that 's the first thing to understand . so consider what you 're going to use the device for . if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory . if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books . review of zen xtra - 40 gb the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity . 
size this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size . 
case it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly . 
cover the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid . as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it . it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot . the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name . 
software extremely convenient . then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer . you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player . ( wo n't leave copy on your computer . ) the pros and cons of it : 
price great price . the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory . 
software i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all . 
scroll the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal . it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here . 
size it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it . for me , that was the only drawback . 
player i 'm really happy with this purchase . also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability . if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause . after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't . so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed . if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .

"yet another inferior knockoff . granted this is cheaper than an ipod . cheaper in every way . 
weight,size its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket . 
playlist its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) . 
battery life it also has unproven battery life . everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies . use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) . while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it . i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .

cd rip i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me . 
transfter file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 . several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title . this is possible ! ! since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album . solution ? simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names . using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums . even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player . 
software my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field . weird . how does it sound ? 
sound to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player . no complaints there . 
eax the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train . 
navigation navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it . 
player at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .","[{'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'rip', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'transfter', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'sound', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'eax', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'navigation', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,excellent way carry music collection investigating multitude player option asked received 60 gb zen xtra christmas size despite slightly larger ipod must say surprised see small unwrapped box cd rip ripping cd collection 160 kbps wma file give average around 6065 mb per cd good 900 cd 57000 mb free memory available transfter file transfer fast nearly song per second via usb 20 several people complained difficulty transferring multiple song title possible since zen xtra use folder structure duplicate name problem stem actual file name song title artist album solution simply configure mediasource software window medium player ripperdujour create file name include artist especially album name addition track name using method encountered situation track rejected plenty duplicate track live compilation album even happened identical track title disc could still edit file name manually get onto player software one issue mediasource software despite pulling id3 tag data cdds service ripping process fails populate year field weird sound sound ear 160 kbps wma file sound good source cd zen xtra sound good portable cd player complaint eax eax feature pretty cool well creative included number eq adjustment example compensate extraneous noise encountered car train navigation navigation could better nt really anything zen xtra gotten comfortable player end day wanted largecapacity player allows easily play album collection wherever go zen xtra combination price capacity feature easily meet criterion

"the best ipod alternative . i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player . i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums . despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online . 
zen xtra after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed . i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty . 
battery first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod . 
battery it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted . creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery . 
software the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use . point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest . 
playlist,cd rip you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player . 
transfer and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy . you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player . 
sound,volume the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise . 
earbud i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well . 
earbud they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department . 
equalizer i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too . there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will . it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it . 
clip however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off . it happened to me once . so now i keep it in my pocket . 
case also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display . it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it . that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .","[{'feature': 'xtra', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'playlist', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'rip', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'transfer', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'sound', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'volume', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'earbud', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'earbud', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'equalizer', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'clip', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'case', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,best ipod alternative shopped around buying harddrive mp3 player read review compared spec visited user forum despite hype ipod knew wanted something different wanted storage ipod could afford would offer wanted flexibility purchased music online zen xtra consideration chose 40gb nomad zen xtra creative disappointed purchased retail store got extended warranty battery first battery replacable user creative intended unlike apple ipod battery easy enough remove front plate one way battery could inserted creative also sell battery via website shipping player waiting sent back new battery software new organizer software ship nomad zen xtra could nt easier use point medium sniffer music file let rest playlistcd rip create playlist drag drop song playlist player rip directly cd player transfer usb 20 transferring music player incredibly easy also delete song player create playlist fly player soundvolume sound great volume satisfactory commute shutting external noise earbud thought buy set headphone use included earbuds work quite well earbud could comfortable complaint sound department equalizer played around equalizer setting satisfied range choice plenty feature nt checked sure soon ship carrying case belt clip clip however nt like carry belt clip nt secure case slip happened keep pocket case also carrying case came mine cover display even though side control reachable open see display would better sort window teh carrying case could see display without opening real complaint nomad zen xtra though
"important zen information . 
player,software this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues . zen good points : 
storage 1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more . 2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous . 
stoppage the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click . flaws : 
software 1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? 
mediasource mediasource did not recognize my tags ! my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource . i do n't think so . btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality  tag information . 
eax 2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax . after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player . when i turned eax off the static disappeared . when i turned eax back on the static was also not present . 
eax creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static . is eax faulty ? is my unit defective ? was i just unlucky at that moment ? was it a full moon that night ? i have n't figured it out yet . 
mediasource 3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . do not underestimate this in your purchase decision . many reviewers refer to it as "" clunky "" or "" difficult "" - heed their warnings . some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ; i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution . 
folder structure 4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) . 
storage in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) . my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake . 
stop button 5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button . 
manual but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version . to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it . 
usb recharge 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice . if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx . 
mediasource 7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ; i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error . creative provided e-mail support ; i followed their advice but that failed , too . i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine . so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error . however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution . third party software to the rescue after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems . i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily . this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( . 
notmad m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ... conclusion : if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen . 
software given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software . and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ... to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ; i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ; i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer . the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).","[{'feature': 'player', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'storage', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'stoppage', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'mediasource', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'eax', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'eax', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'mediasource', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'structure', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'storage', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'button', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'manual', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'recharge', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'mediasource', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'notmad', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,important zen information playersoftware player overall disappointment couple big flaw potential buyer wary reader need know third party software company resolve virtually creative mediasource file transfer issue zen good point storage 1 achieved basic objective entire cd collection portable device lot room store 2 mp3 player gap end one track start next annoying music intended continuous stoppage zen minimal stoppage track listening music continues one track next gap hesitation slightly audible click listening progress one track next nt even notice click flaw software 1 creative mediasource software ok rip catalog burn music starting scratch used musicmatch rip cd bought zen 278 cd 3400 track 125 gb music ripped 128bps guess mediasource mediasource recognize tag choice moment manually retag music rerip using mediasource nt think btw ripping cd mediasource access cddb music catalog internet cd experimented provided good quality tag information eax 2 despite reviewer giving kudos zen music quality experienced flaw using eax 45 min listening audible static player turned eax static disappeared turned eax back static also present eax creative sound people computer understand eax would introduce static eax faulty unit defective unlucky moment full moon night nt figured yet mediasource 3 mediasource application serious user interface flaw underestimate purchase decision many reviewer refer clunky difficult heed warning amazon reviewer say corrrupted music file nt use long enough know clearly need use caution folder structure 4 zen store data file allow folder structure allow document opened program launched disk must copied another hard drive launched storage word zen convenient data storage device buy capacity need music collection see point 1 sizing information goal using music player data storage device met nt make mistake stop button 5 zen stop button stop playback pressing 2 button first pause button next track previous track button manual documented zen manual neither hard copy cd version discover read 10 online review many complaint lack stop button found one reviewer smart enough figure document usb recharge 6 zen nx battery requires ac adapter recharge charge usb cable tragic usb recharging would convenient additional choice buying zen xtra check whether battery recharges via usb zen nx mediasource 7 mediasource install personal notebook referred microsoft jet database engine error install program suggested download service pack m website fix problem reinstalled software error creative provided email support followed advice failed experimented installing mediasource 2 computer home worked fine probably bad luck part personal notebook install error however motivate find workaround solution third party software rescue much frustration found notmad explorer cute product name software resolve virtually creative mediasource file transfer organization problem associated company providing url search notmad find pretty easily provides drag drop transfer music computer zen time transfer music zen asks want generate playlist allows playlist developed software transferred zen notmad m3u file used mp3 player like musicmatch winamp creative without notmad need manually recreate playlist nt care software use rip catalog music creative company 125 gb music transferred zen correct tag hooray notmad feature advertisement please see company web site information conclusion knew know would paid extra get ipod avoided zen software given already zen reason happy notmad software hoping static heard using eax blip summarize using creative zen mobile device using musicmatch rip catalog choose download music using notmad explorer move music playlist zen computer creative software using device driver
"how did i get by without this ? this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .

memory i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory . 
sound quality the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !

software the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . 
napster one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software . my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things . 
name they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) . whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) . minor gripe . i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .","[{'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'memory', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'navigation', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'operate', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'napster', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'name', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,get without one item first glance looked cool nt really ring bell player however imagine without memory stored around 60 cd 160kbps barely touched available memory sound quality sound quality fantastic cd quality really great carry around instead stack cd tape navigation exceedingly simple navigate around device operate nt read thing operate intuitive cruising around device within 20 minute software pcside software goofy take little getting used bad reviewer indicated napster one plus napster support device via software one recommendation creative get marketing people work name thing name whole bunch device samesounding name long whereas folk ipod nomad jukebox zen xtra confused nomad jukebox zen nx minor gripe imagine would spend hundred dollar ipod
"great memory , quality ? 
player i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason . in a quick summation , here is what i found .

software - the software that came with it was tough to load . i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .

"flimsy product . i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery . 
construction the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player . this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched . i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .

"the 3 ( ? ! ) month warranty should be a warning . like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product . 
price the price / performance looked just right . when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff . boy was i wrong . reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it . that 's been my experience . if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty . but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty . now i know better . 
headphone jack i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ? so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back . from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles . 
construction i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy . now let 's talk about the software . 
installation like other reviewers , installation was hell . subsequent behavior even worse . 
software about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc . 
online help after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all . 
player in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered . finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing . 
installation to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .

"great value & great sound ; carry your entire collection ! pros : 
sound,power output 1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers . 
volume with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) . 
player the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers . 
user interface,navigation 2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection . 
nomad explorer 3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player . 
nomad explorer the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . 
usb 2.0 4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). 
battery 5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace . 
battery life 6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's . 
look,build 7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate . 
player i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine . 
mediasource 8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ). a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc. 
id3 tag i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags . 
cd rip b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive . 
sync c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer . 
wake up 9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time . i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning . 
play mode 10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter . 
pause 11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player 
storage 12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! cons : 
plug and play 1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it . 
id3 2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information . this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music . 
folder 3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files . this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags . the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files . 
fm,voice recording 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . 
accessory 5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing . both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters . a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary . 
case 6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed . i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case . 
flip switch 7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch . experience : once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player . this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) . i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen . also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates . recommendations : 1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive . 2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one . 3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year . 4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. ) 5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped . resources : http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net pros summary :

"the best jukebox mp3 player , hands-down . i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 . 
player the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market . the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software . 
software fact is , it could n't be easier to use . these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player . assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra . 
sound quality sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products . 
sound even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback . 
menu the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily . 
battery the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter . 
player connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library . awesome feature . 
usb 2.0 usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast . 
folder minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable . that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually . 
folder the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name . not a big hassle as many would have you think . 
id3 tag 2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . "" i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only . when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra . take the time to fill in those tags ! 
nomad explorer 3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software . 
nomad explorer in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . so what are you waiting for ? get one now !","[{'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'sound', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'menu', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': '0', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'folder', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'folder', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'tag', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'explorer', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'explorer', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}]",Creative MP3,best jukebox mp3 player handsdown bought 30gb zen xtra wellknown national electronics store soon saw advertising 21999 player combination price storage size player feature make player best market biggest drawback people zen xtra software software fact could nt easier use model ship creative mediasource program allows highlight file computer want add zen xtra click button transfer straight player assuming filled id3 tag mp3s problem finding zen xtra sound quality sound quality amazing creative product sound even leaving default setting without eax enhancement produce crystal clear playback menu menu allows search file artist genre album quite easily battery battery stay charged long time take 2 3 hour fully recharge via included ac adapter player connect player computer via usb open mediasource listen stored mp3s stream directly xtra get mp3s hard drive save space enjoy massive music library awesome feature usb 20 usb 20 transfer insanely fast folder minor complaint 1 even though music sorted via id3 tag player option search music contained folder unavailable folder computer called mp3 slayer thrash metal stravinsky classical ice cube rap able play content folder searching artist genre manually folder zen xtra transfer file player folder name big hassle many would think id3 tag 2 unfilled id3 tag cause music potentially placed folder called unknown would recommend using id3v2 tag stick id3v1 previous version zen shipped musicmatch people problem musicmatch creates set tag seem confuse zen xtra take time fill tag nomad explorer 3 mediasource easy found use bundled nomad explorer software nomad explorer fact caused system hang time uninstalled stuck mediasource 100 waiting get one

eax first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes . at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not . it was just a problem with the player . 
menue,control second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .

button the general button placement is not very user friendly . this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .

"creative nomad zen xtra 40 gb . 
price overall , a good buy for the price . 
navigation easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton . 
battery life my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of . 
battery there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + . i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight . no difference . if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought . 
lock up i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times . the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it . that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty . 
construction the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .

"hard disk mp3 players . if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later . if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet . all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while . if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you . ipod clearly has the most buzz . great design and looks cool . most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons . it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used . some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface . everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction . ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem . however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization . synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized . reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item . after that it seems like you 're on your own . ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it "" unnecessary "" and "" so 20th century "" . 
construction,support,scroll wheel,headphone jack creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack . construction quality is a difficult item . the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced . 
build what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) . many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen . 
support feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products . 
scroll wheel the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device . 
software the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers . 
headphone jack enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem . 
folder the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best . 
sound quality reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . the zen has no stop button . veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want . the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk . it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing . if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about . karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity . usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback . repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist - you just have to buy a new player . perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories . like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device . it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates . the karma does have a stop button . there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp . those that have it like it . the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) . otherwise feedback seems to be good . no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories . no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one . none of these are perfect . if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you . accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less . if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 . if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .","[{'feature': 'construction', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'support', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'wheel', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'jack', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'build', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'support', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'wheel', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'jack', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'folder', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,hard disk mp3 player read review 4 main contender market ipod creative zen rio karma iriver ihp notice pro con none perfect decide whether want take take plunge later view life going pay x00 get device must near ideal ruggedly constructed fault proof good product support easy use software favor nt buy yet product drawback mature yet expect value reliability wait ok paying x00 something used likely get better cost less future try determine device lesser evil ipod clearly buzz great design look cool people love appearance praise touch sensitive button hold button deactivate button avoid accident however enough reviewer complained hold button easily broken device used geeky nonapple type reviewer complain scrollwheel annoying resent forced applelike interface everyone complains nonreplaceable battery yet price sturdy construction ipod used external disk apparently store file without problem however music data apparently separated ipod reviewer complain white noise random feedback mode come appointment contact created ipod synchronization synchronizing music among computer one seems issue research buying multiple computer want synchronized review sound quality generally universally positive review apple support generally poor seem address issue warranty cover short time delivery pickup item seems like ipod stop button new user mention ipod veteran call unnecessary 20th century constructionsupportscroll wheelheadphone jack creative zen feedback suffers construction quality poor product support difficulty using scroll wheel reasonably consistent feedback problem headphone jack construction quality difficult item zen detachable face plate allows battery replaced build added functionality battery replacement detracts build quality face plate prone popping drop inch hard surface faceplate pop case many reviewer say faceplate simply nt fit well returned zen support feedback creative product support universally poor limited zen applies company product scroll wheel scroll wheel finicky work time learning curve pressing right new user say 50 75 success rate find frustrating return device software creative software awkward difficult use plain nt load computer headphone jack enough people reported headphone jack nt work month using device believe creative inbuilt manufacturing quality control problem folder zen nt support folder really storage device even third party software creates folder document program launched zen hard disk storage device best sound quality review sound quality generally universally positive zen stop button veteran zen user explained stop want rio karma feedback suffers sensitivity hard disk seems like movement even small movement cause skipping playback even device freezing plan carry device around mobile device right something might want think karma get consistently good review sound quality connectivity docking device rca output jack ethernet jack connectivity usability button usage feature selection menu structure display size quality also good feedback repair seems issue say repair nt exist buy new player perhaps smaller user base also lack accessory like zen karma support folder designed data storage device come 20gb enough people large collection ripped high sampling rate karma stop button nt many review iriver ihp like complaint seems disk rotation slow leading longer delay function playback even slow display menu otherwise feedback seems good comment reliability warranty repair accessory noone mention whether stop button photo nt show one none perfect appetite choose one think least deficiency best suited accept better device new generation one year two cost less pay money learn experience informed buyer buy device 2 nt paying x00 learn experiment con outweigh pro wait year

"software problem . 
player i bought the player this week and i like it by far . this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative . here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one . pro : 1 . 
battery removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years . my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up . his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now . 2 . 
value value : comparing data storage with price . 3 . size and style : 
appearance the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) . 
size the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . ) 4 . 
use easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this con : 
mediasource the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) . a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here . 
software in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place . however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems . i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem . ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more ) now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource . 
size,value,design,software in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software","[{'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'value', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'appearance', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'use', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'mediasource', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'value', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'design', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,software problem player bought player week like far fourth mp3 player creative nomad jukebox2 3 rio chie one third player creative something know considering buying one pro 1 battery removable cheap battery li battery usually work properly 13 year friend ipod 2 year battery messed ipod play couple hour fully recharging 2 value value comparing data storage price 3 size style appearance appearance okayed least ugly size size small little bit bigger ipod 4 use easy use lot review mentioned con mediasource software mediasource work pc laptop intel p420 xp o ton reveiws reported problem software fact creative mp3 player software problem first place however creative lab come new update fix software problem crossing finger wish fix problem p mediasource provides similar function m mediaplay like cd ripping tagging music database managing music file transfering use m mediaplayer musicmatch free downladed explorer computer grab file disk c player replace mediasource sizevaluedesignsoftware short player good size value hardware design really bad software
"a great player , excellent sound quality , hovewer , has flaws . alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player . well to say , i had a very bad history with players . one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 . if you are planning to buy that player , do not ! that player is a complete piece of sh ***. i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap . now getting back to this . i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks . now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws . cons : 1 . 
display the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly 2 . 
storage huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you . ( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) . and those songs mostly are 320 kbps. 3 . 
sound the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack . 4 . 
eax with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it . 5 . 
software if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs . you can also search for your song , which is good . 6 . 
software i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome . you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem . and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem . 7 . 
battery battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours . 8 . 
player when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off . 9 . 
manage you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed . 
interface you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical . 
alarm there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good . 
clock there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful . 10 . 
firmware the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any . 11 . 
music the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption . cons : 1 . 
battery life the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life . the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 . 5 hours max. i did it like this eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours 2 . 
panel the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said . 3 . 
transfer you need the software to actually transfer files 4 . 
player the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings . 
lock up also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying . ( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points ) well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .","[{'feature': 'display', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'storage', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'sound', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'eax', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'manage', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'interface', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'alarm', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'clock', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'firmware', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'music', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'panel', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'transfer', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'player', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'up', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,great player excellent sound quality hovewer flaw alright well read alot review read alot bad good thing player well say bad history player one broke one got stolen bought riovolt sp 350 planning buy player player complete piece sh returned sent back crap getting back ordered player christmas far 2 week others said far player awesome player flaw con 1 display display awesome see everything want read clearly 2 storage huge storage space loaded entire collection music isnt much 400 song still 26 gb 28 provided 28 30 software take space song mostly 320 kbps 3 sound sound awesome u put loud depends yoursound quality sound might crack 4 eax eax modify sound 4 different presets pretty good get different variation 5 software use software correctly put id3 tag get awesome database collection easily access song also search song good 6 software dont know people saying software awesome easily access ur file easily fill id3 tag take big collection music lazy without problem read today also online fill id3 problem 7 battery battery recharge awesome thing recharges like 23 hour 8 player turn player player turn really fast music continues play left turning 9 manage manage profile change contrast backlight make different type display either list tabbed interface different thing choose kind playing interface see interface modern classical alarm alarm still havent used yet good clock clock date get helpful 10 firmware player firmware remove glitch 11 music music play awesome never skip even u run bit listen music without interruption con 1 battery life one major thing dissapointed player battery life product manufacturer promised 14 hour recieved 68 5 hour max like eax 6 hour eax 85 hour 2 panel panel seems like come easily people said 3 transfer need software actually transfer file 4 player player minor glitch like example turn 60 percent time sais shutting mean turn turn liking lock also player sometimes freeze big problem also annoying hard drive freeze certain point well thats people said earlier preview headfone jack get messed stil havent happened hope doesnt
"easy to use , massive storage space , sounds great . 
price and also , it 's priced very affordably . 
storage with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more . a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room . having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there . having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage . 
software the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted . 
sound,earbud the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones . on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good . 
sound setting sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference . 
accessing file accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive . 
battery possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery . 
battery since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) . 
value,use try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface . i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad . the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me . 
color i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy . the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage . my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .","[{'feature': 'price', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'storage', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'sound', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'earbud', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'setting', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'file', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'value', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'use', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'color', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}]",Creative MP3,easy use massive storage space sound great price also priced affordably storage 40gb storage 7500 song player everything music file room 2500 similarily priced 15gb ipod would nt nearly enough room entire music collection great travelling plane car trip nt decide bring copy onto player copy delete file would timeconsuming rendered nonissue 40gb storage software software interface supplied easy use went ahead got red chair notmad software advanced feature wanted soundearbud sound great even supplied earbuds find earbuds uncomfortable use different headphone plane use splitter two headphone plugged two people sound equally good sound setting sound setting adjusted personal preference accessing file accessing file artist album mostly look thing artist easy intuitive battery possibly biggest advantage player price nt enough fact user replace battery opening lid popping new battery battery since battery run everything also big moneysaver since ipod irivers rca dell builtin battery need replaced technician apple charge 100 bone battery replacement valueuse try buy possible although mac addict decade everyone know previously bought ipod nomad zen xtra far better value easy use regard hardware software interface personally crazy look either ipod nomad ipod white plastic look surface nt suit color like nomad color better terribly flashy mini ipod look best 4gb way would ever buy mp3 player measly 4gb storage advice mp3 buyer consider much storage space need try listen buy mp3 player fully evaluated holding listening

"i do n't see what everyone 's problem is - i love this player . 
player this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .

size,design the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods . it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods . 
build it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it . 
control i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least . 
scroll wheel the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there . 
screen the screen 's large and easily read . 
pop-up face the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect . 
sound sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod . from what i 've heard it 's at least equal . like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels . there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far . 
interface interface - practically seamless . songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver . 
id3 tag yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy . it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better . you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search . 
playlist playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options . 
balance the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . software : 
mediasource as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better . 
mediasource it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files . 
id3 tag the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well . 
software it was no problem for me to use their software . some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive . the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience . 
player overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too . so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .

"o man , not cool . ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one . 
player honestly , i love this player . one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one . 
sound,battery life once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life . ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me . 
hard drive however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once . therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) . if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty . if it does , ill give up . basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed . thats it . i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back . the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now . basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 . you know why ? 
break because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible . now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind . i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . . honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players . this is all i have to say .","[{'feature': 'player', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'sound', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'drive', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'break', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Creative MP3,man cool ok im writing yet another review week previous one player honestly love player one horrible flaw mayybe one soundbattery life sound awesome batterly life 68 hour music 320 kbps affect battery life ok donno people said player break stuff headfone jack fortunately happen hard drive however hard drive fail dropped therefore im saying im returning right see wat happens next zen xtra replacement one fails hope let happen first 90 day later cuz thats warranty ill give basically wat happened hard drive failed thats cant anything send back good thing whole process im getting like 34 dollar amount back price difference bought basically u see given player 3 star instead 1 know break people complain player talking bull player awesome break fast horrible honestly love player seriousness would recommend people breakdown flaw honestly would recomment people ipod crap suck big donkey never mind hope next player doesnt breakdown honestly best player without flaw goddam cd player say

"you will be very disappointed with this product . the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months . those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it . the price is way below an ipod of the same size . the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod . 
sound quality the sound quality is very good . 
control,software the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this . because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it . for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection . 
storage having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific . they fall in love with the product . and then it breaks . usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires . 
headphone jack typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others . the nomad is sent back to creative labs . they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it . in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it . like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it . if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two . 
design i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use . 
headphone jack the headphone jack seems to be a major problem . 
front cover the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily . 
headphone jack the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire . even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty . and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase . this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it . so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad . you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back . you will have a very expensive paperweight . there are not a lot of good options out there . most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery . my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops . maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again . maybe more competitors will bring out similar products . and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod . whatever you do , do n't buy this product . you will be sorry if you do .","[{'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'control', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'storage', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'jack', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'design', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'jack', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'cover', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'jack', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Creative MP3,disappointed product review product roughly divided two group 1 product week 2 product month nomad week mostly thrilled price way ipod size nomad sligtly larger ipod sound quality sound quality good controlsoftware control somewhat harder use oddity software tagging system people live large capacity nomad owner load hundred cd people carry around almost music collection storage access much music ever go terrific fall love product break usually around time 90 day warranty expires headphone jack typically problem headphone jack many others nomad sent back creative lab decide owner responsible damage even returned within warranty period creative charge fix case bill 81 third paid like many others abused product tried take care level care nt good enough expect even paid fixed would break month two design convinced experience many people posted experience product defectively designed hold normal use headphone jack headphone jack seems major problem front cover one thing observed nomad front cover taken access battery seemed come undone easily headphone jack headphone jack failure seems occur warrranty period expire even nt expired creative likely claim owner caused damage turn void warranty store take back product 90 day purchase mean nomad long enough load lot music get used break find disappointed depressed loss nomad find hard impossible get money back expensive paperweight lot good option people say buy ipod pretty expensive also require send product back factory replace battery suggestion wait see market develops maybe creative come better design although hard customer trust maybe competitor bring similar product maybe answer buy ipod whatever nt buy product sorry

"only "" cons "" here the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree . but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though , 
auto mode . this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped . would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing . . if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data . so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time . in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time . 
image . even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image 
indoor image . images taken indoor were n't so clear . you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit 
lens cap . lens cap is a really annoying . go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card . else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 . 
movie . the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .

"amazing camera i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world . 
camera nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price . here were my requirements in a digital camera : 1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while . 2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that . i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily . 3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings . 4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much . depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models . nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews . i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since . 
picture the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details . a few things that might make it even better : 
indoor picture 1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . 
delay 2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . 
picture 3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture . all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints . try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems . whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty . and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness . hope this review has helped you in making up your mind . i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience . i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .","[{'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'picture', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'picture', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'delay', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'picture', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Nikon Camera,amazing camera amateur photographer piece advise folk thinking making move digital world camera nikon 4300 feel best camera feature price requirement digital camera 1 initially thought buying 2 3 megapixel camera good 4x6 5x7 print wanted really great 8x10 photo 2 want small camera seems get lost hand nt comfortable wanted decent sized camera contour finger hold steadily 3 wanted camera lot builtin setting different type suroundings giving option use photography skill although amateur interest photography turning manual setting 4 course wanted respected brand stay within budget bought expensive camcorder nt used much depending requirement narrowed search nikon 4300 canon powershot s400 model nikon got final nod setting auto manual along movie mode medium compact size price brand name good software included previous review say happy decision ever since picture picture absolutely amazing camera capture minutest detail thing might make even better indoor picture 1 picture taken indoor setting little dull rarely hazy tend take photograph distance delay 2 take camera actually capture photograph time click button seen people becoming little impatient waiting flash glow picture 3 picture come hazy hand shake even moment entire process taking picture think problem digital camera major complaint try buy tripod solve problem whichever camera buy add upto 200 dollar additional memory card bought 256 mb card usb card reader camera bag warranty finally get picture developed kodak picture maker machine even though cost little extra one beat kodak processing term clarity brightness hope review helped making mind taken 150 photograph far absolutely loved experience looking forward vega trip great photograph
"super camera with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age . i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 . the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures . 
auto mode, manual mode, scene mode the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless . 
movie mode the movie mode is also working great . 
software the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable . a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution . 
print i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results . 
print even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" . 
battery life the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on . i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" . i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need : a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger . furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "" .

"camera shake after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one . i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures . however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy . anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix . 
picture focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange . pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry . pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent . the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models . anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix . i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about . however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .","[{'feature': 'picture', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Nikon Camera,camera shake reading glowing review camera went local camera shop try one currently olympus d550 take wonderful outdoor picture however indoor picture subject foot away blurry grainy anyway store tried coolpix 4300 along two 4mp model minolta dimage s414 panasonic lumix picture focusing display rack 20 foot away brightly lit room day time picture produced camera blurry shade orange picture produced minolta orange blurry picture produced panasonic excellent store clerk concluded blurriness may caused shaking camera slightly press button understandable since camera lighter two model anyway ended purchasing lumix sure camera wonderful feature others talk however average person unsteady hand doubt perform well lower light setting

photo just point and shoot and the photos were great . just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .

"field tested we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos . 
nikon 4300 the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust . it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade ! we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend . the only drawbacks that i have noticed : 
battery it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot . so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging . 
auto-focus assist light it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light . i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things . 
optical zoom it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras . for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length . it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality . i set the camera to the "" manual "" mode for one main reason : in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries . in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features . in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models ! it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera . 
camera it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping . for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .

"absolutely great point and shoot camera first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake . for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives . and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 . 
camera i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations . 
picture,indoor shot the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away . the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more . 
image download uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple . 
indoor shot the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr . right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras . 
battery life 2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations . i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died . an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment . 
software 3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust . i 'll still use my photosuite for editing . one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing . just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine . 
camera in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range . - since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera . i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful . i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit . i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand . i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set . this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters . i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time . this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap . the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .","[{'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'picture', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'shot', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'download', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'shot', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'camera', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Nikon Camera,absolutely great point shoot camera first let start need 1 500 budget 2 4mp resolution 3 optical clarity color 4 fast little shutter lag quick sepup next picture 5 compact size 6 good camera grip minimize camera shake three month researched internet magazine queried various sale personnel took handson instore test drive finally settled nikon coolpix 4300 camera week camera exceeded expectation pictureindoor shot daylight picture brilliant indoor shot good provided subject 8 foot away shutter lag par experienced point shoot 35mm aps film camera next frame advance couple second using high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card salesperson recommended high speed card since next frame advance speed important dollar image download uploading image windowsbased pc fast simple indoor shot drawback encountered 1 indoor shot distance 8ft lack contrast color found problem camera builtin flash used even nikon slr right researching inexpensive slave flash unit designed digital camera battery life 2 battery life seems short side adequate situation got 45 outdoor 15 indoor shot monitor turning camera 4 hour period battery died extra backup battery would good investment software 3 picture editing software came adequate robust still use photosuite editing one thing indoor shot many review knocked camera low light focusing heck took dark kitchen indirect light coming though door focusing fine camera summary love camera would wholeheartedly recommend anyone wanting high quality point shoot camera medium price range since wrote review january 2003 still love camera picked accessory found useful bought digislave dsf1s flash unit nt use bracket hold head aim flash left hand also got ure 4 step ring adapter lce 900 lens cap nikon 28mm filter set provides added protection camera lens allows use filter leave adapter uv filter time also allows turn camera without remove lens cap downside might accidentally take picture lens cap camera wo nt fit small case 28mm filter expensive hard find

"great camera i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one . this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com . 
camera i have not been disappointed with my purchase . 
picture quality picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm . 
indoor shot on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm . however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures . 
camera i am extremely satisfied with this camera . i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion . buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short . do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card . you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution . i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember : read the directions ! the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings . 
scene mode the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting . i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .

"good phone , so-so service . 
sprint the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint . 
sprint plan,sprint customer service after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent . i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl . 
size, sturdy here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy . 
game,pim,radio it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio ! 
reception i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable . also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious . 
sound volume, ear the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine ! 
ringtone,background,screensaver,memory the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) . 
color the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be . however , it serves its purpose . 
backlight the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this -- i checked with nokia . 
button the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly . 
menu options the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) . more downside to this phone ? 
volume the volume . oh my goodness -- 
volume i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet . forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person ! 
battery life on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life . 
phone i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it . i was surprised by t-mobile 's service . 
t-mobile reception i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous . reason ? they piggy-back on cingular 's service . 
t-zone also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works . 
customer service since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" . 
t-zone i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked . 24 hours ? by what time standards -- martian ? 
t-mobile apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands . also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out . 
customer rep in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions . but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you . i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me : "" when will my t-zones work ? "" , csr : "" i 'm not sure "" . ) . umm , well , thanks for nothing . this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. . that was annoying .

battery i treat the battery well and it has lasted . at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days . it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls . signal strength will affect the battery life . frequent signal searches eat up battery power . i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover . i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at . 
volume the volume level of the phone is not all that good . 
ring some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to . 
tone the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . 
vibration the vibration is not top . it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in . i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it . vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this . so it was no loss .

"perfect . 
phone anything this phone does , it does perfectly . 
speakerphone,radio the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly . the speakerphone : 
speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone . 
speakerphone as said before this works perfectly . 
volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . 
speakerphone the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly . 
speakerphone you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly . 
speakerphone only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing . the radio : 
radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in . 
radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly . tri-band : 
feature one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia . 
phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . 
t-mobile the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile . 
reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception . if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe . sold in other parts of the world : 
phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . 
phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe . i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service . able to use service in another country : if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country . you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country . size and weight : 
size,weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light . 
size this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . battery life : 
battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal . it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby . 
battery i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . 
battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light . 
phone this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial . 
bluetooth,high speed internet the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do . 
phone overall , i highly recommend this phone . 
phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .","[{'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'speakerphone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'radio', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'speakerphone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'speakerphone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'volume', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'speakerphone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'speakerphone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'speakerphone', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'radio', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'radio', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'mobile', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'reception', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'weight', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'bluetooth', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'internet', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}]",Nokia Phone,perfect phone anything phone perfectly speakerphoneradio speakerphone radio feature work perfectly speakerphone speakerphone phone cool useful feature speakerphone speakerphone said work perfectly volume adjust volume heard anywhere nt make big disturbance speakerphone person end call hear perfectly speakerphone 3 foot away still work perfectly speakerphone one complaint speakerphone activate speakerphone feature person calling answer phone ringing radio radio phone one phone fm radio tuner built radio radio receives fairly decent reception nearly good normal radio long station coming clearly phone radio work perfectly triband feature one highly beneficial feature phone least used anywhere world except country use gsm asia phone bought phone trip south africa worked almost perfectly tmobile problem small glitch tmobile reception anywhere went south africa phone received full bar reception worked like south africa imagine would work without hitch europe sold part world phone another benefit phone truly international phone 6610 sold almost everywhere world phone mean good chance phone break easily like typical american phone rare occasion bring tmobile store located many country europe stress enough big benefit european phone european company providing cell phone service able use service another country decide go another country extended period time buy sim card service provider country would phone number country pay international roaming country size weight sizeweight put phone pocket forget unbelievably small oh light size benefit many reason one appearance pant wo nt bulging phone pocket battery life battery life battery life phone surreal last truly 7 day standby battery used speakerphone almost two hour battery even go one single bar battery amazing battery last long phone small light phone phone many feature ir name one feature view beneficial bluetoothhigh speed internet phone minor inconvenience lack feature bluetooth high spend internet problem thing expected phone phone overall highly recommend phone phone perfect phone small appealing package

"it works ... as a phone ! perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest . after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform . i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device . 
wireless telephone although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone . 
reception,sound quality the reception and sound quality are top-notch . i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service . 
size,weight i like the size and weight of this little critter . 
size i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed . 
layout the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird . 
key the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead . but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle . 
screen the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors . 
picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones . 
user interface there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient . 
menu option the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad . thumbs down on that one . 
vibrate setting the vibrate setting is loud ! 
vibrate setting so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option . 
ringer but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. . which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ... 
voice dialing,headset jack other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack . i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ... pros : 
weight, design - light , compact design 
construction - solid , high-quality construction 
keypad - well-backlit keypad 
reception - outstanding signal reception 
sound quality - excellent sound quality 
screen - bright , visible screen 
speakerphone - speakerphone 
battery life - very long-lasting battery life cons :

"cool phone ! like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program . i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me . pros : 
size small size . 
size i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it . just make sure the keys are locked . 
color screen color screen is good . 
calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar . 
key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing . 
menu navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone . 
battery life battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . cons : not many . 
volume key the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call . 
pc cable pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ? please ! is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?","[{'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'screen', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'calendar', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'key', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'menu', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'key', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'cable', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Nokia Phone,cool phone like reviewer recieved phone using tmobiles upgrade program comparing 3650 3560 3595 could nt settle along came 6610 perfect pro size small size size love fact carry shirt pant pocket forget make sure key locked color screen color screen good calendar lot feature calendar work like outlook calendar key key laid normal guessing menu navigating menu super easy especially owned previous model nokia phone battery life battery life good use every day charge every 5 6 day con many volume key volume key hard press think may design rather flaw perhaps keep pressing accidentally call pc cable pc cable expensive 50 usb cable please nokia subsidizes free pc software
"slightly better than average phone in its class . first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) . my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone . below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends : sound quality : the most important thing for me is sound quality . 
sound quality nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception . i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series . 
loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk . overall design : 
size i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets . of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest . the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small . as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys . ease of use : how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ? the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) . that is a very nice feature . the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) . the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use . battery : the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much . the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) . features : the t610 has the most functionality hands down . personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice . my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity . the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use . 
radio the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless . 
application it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) . the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla . all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready . in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones . 
software regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop . i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft . oh well .. 
phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone . both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 . personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more . i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year . if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 . they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .","[{'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'radio', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'application', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'software', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}]",Nokia Phone,slightly better average phone class first big nokia fan upgrading cell phone year right release contract last phone samsung s105 imo superior cheaper phone evaulate phone tmobile phone borrowed parent friend sound quality important thing sound quality sound quality nokias always good sound quality exception think sound quality phone slightly better samsung phone motorolla t720 series sony ericsson t610 series loud phone loud speaker function 6610 great nt need put phone right next ear talk overall design size like phone small fit pocket phone motorolla sony ericsson phone smallest 6610 actually longest small much like nokia phone flip phone imo much better wont scratch screen key b dont need lock phone time prevent accidently hitting key ease use easy get certain menu samsung phone customize function assign certain function directional button like assign alarm clock left directional key nice feature 6610 still easier use two phone t610 t720i sony ericsson phone t610 whistle bell also hardest use battery nokia samsung sony phone last 3 day provided nt talk much motorolla phone horrible battery last day although heard motorolla t722i much longer battery life feature t610 functionality hand personally found integrated digital camera t610 nice girlfriend paranoid around take pic send spot regain sanity t610 also compose music feature wo nt use radio 6610 radio function utterly useless application also stock tracking app built also useless somewhat useful application convert type metric currency length area etc s105 samsung beautiful big display 65000 color say much motorolla phone color screen polymorphic tone internet ready music tone department 6610 20 chord thats number different instrument play think samsung think 15 donno phone feel t610 best sounding ring tone software regarding pc software support nokia suite work version xp tried connect phone via infrared port laptop called nokia tech support blamed microsoft oh well phone overall slightly better average phone samsung sony phone offer lot feature 6610 personally like samsung phone better found liking flip phone much think good chance try get samsung flip camera phone next year tmobile offer phone likely get t610 free get new account anyway stick tmobile going use phone overseas tmobile actually allows unlock simm card buy simm card cheap nation plug phone international travelling

phone the phones are awesome . 
battery life,reception, application we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome . here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth . 
pc suite you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .

phone,screen,ergonomics,size this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one . 
size this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out . the downside though , may be a big one for you . 
volume its quiet . really quiet . grandma in church quiet . i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it . so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )","[{'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'screen', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'ergonomics', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'volume', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Nokia Phone,great phone say phonescreenergonomicssize really great little phone got nice feature beatiful screen great ergonomics tiny waited year phone mostly like think didnt really need one size phone big seller size fit nicely pocket without falling downside though may big one volume quiet really quiet grandma church quiet gotten used holding right realation ear ducking quieter place bar others borrow shocked use recomend hearing trouble like talk lot crowded public place annoying way
"incredibly pleased . i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer . prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider . to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing . my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them . 
nokia nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them . 
volume first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint . 
reception i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) . 
size,weight,design the phone is small , light , and very attractive . 
battery life the battery life is amazing . 
color screen,ringtone the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .

"ultimate phone for mobile life . i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features . 
phone, feature it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features . truly , i am quite impressed . . ! ! 
weight,battery life this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) . on an average , you would charge it once a week . 
speakerphone the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . 
speakerphone i simply love this feature . 
headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset . 
radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport . if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more . 
pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) . no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad . just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth . 
tone,wallpaper,application additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. ) 
message,picture sharing the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy . 
mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy . the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff . if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone . however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone . i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon . i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .

"awesome phone choice . after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative . i was immediately interested in the 6610 . i have used this phone for two months now . 
size,feature not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want . if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more . 
use in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned . 
phone book,speakerphone the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent . 
radio even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio . if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are . 
voice dialing although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing . 
key the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press . 
battery life however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off . 
volume control in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control . it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone . 
headphone jack one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work . 
phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned . any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .

"yo what a find . 
phone i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it . 
phone nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby . it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it . now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school ! people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant . 
service,ringtone service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . now i can always be in contact . 
phone this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones . a great deal in general ! i would not give up this phone for the world . 
phone 1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone . 
feature yes , the features are numerous . 
speakerphone the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had . people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone . 
sound quality the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line . 
earpiece the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use . 
phone i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before . nokia has definitely won me over with this one .","[{'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'service', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'ringtone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'feature', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'speakerphone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'earpiece', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Nokia Phone,yo find phone purchased phone 50 end phone nokia tmobile really teamed well baby put end organizational deficiency well communication internet without bulky phone like treo something cell unhappy little 6610 coveted item school people paid money borrow elegant serviceringtone service great far tell feature work like charm ringtones high quality buy tmobile aim great always contact phone probably best bet looking phone price range like patience deal annoying flip phone great deal general would give phone world phone 1 month problem great phone pleased 6610 phone feature yes feature numerous speakerphone speakerphone work better speakerphone ever people talk speakerphone shocked come time even using speakerphone sound quality sound quality excellent except maybe tad quiet time quieter talker end line earpiece included earpiece comfortable easy use phone distortion problem phone pleased phone used nokia definitely one
"best phone out there ... a+ not only is this the best phone out there but is cheap ( free ! ! ) . 
size, look{+1] first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better . 
radio the radio feature has superb sound quality . i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 . even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them . 
design it has a classic design yet looks hip . is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel . 
weight it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket . for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style . 
battery the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there . one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online . every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) . anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) . tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans . if you thought about getting this phone buy it . 
phone this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .","[{'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'radio', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'design', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'weight', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'battery', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Nokia Phone,best phone best phone cheap free size look1 first let say much smaller look web also look better radio radio feature superb sound quality compared phone others 6100 siemens sl55 even though might smaller many people seem alot problem design classic design yet look hip lot better compared toy phone design nokia 7210 cheap feel weight extremely light dissapears pocket looking camera phone get camera attachement come stereo headphone listen radio style battery battery alot better phone one thing found recently nt need tzones tmobile go online every tmobile plan come gsm data meaning instead speed 56 kbps around 9 kbps small size wap website really think make difference anyways way set 6610 connect csd us regular minute surfing net able download pic ringtones java apps need tzones tmobiles might best reception area amazing phone nokia 6610 cheap plan get way minute plan thought getting phone buy phone phone great whole like others one two good quality
"6610 = great phone and a few extras i am a person that needs my phone ( s ) on demand . i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile . the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering ! that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port ! using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account . yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for . i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck ! 
internet the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all . i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .

"do n't have the phone just commenting . i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing . the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia . the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone . my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset . 
game i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing . i do n't really like bounce . i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones . 
battery life battery life is good for a phone of this size . 
voice dialing but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing . 
screen,sound great screen and great sound . ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ? 
phone the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god . 
voice quality,reception the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) . 
screen,command the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive . 
button my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons . nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary . 
key this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands . ( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . ) 
phone other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips . 
t-mobile finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier . 
t-mobile their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience . if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .","[{'feature': 'game', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'life', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'dialing', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'screen', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'sound', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'quality', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'reception', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'screen', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'command', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'button', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'key', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'mobile', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'mobile', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Nokia Phone,nt phone commenting saw another review saying gripe lack voice dialing phone voice dialing according amazon tmobile nokia phone may look large small smaller 3390 phone sister series phone love radio headset game find lack entertaining game phone quite disturbing nt really like bounce always known nokia provide good game phone battery life battery life good phone size voice dialing anyway thing really look fact phone voice dialing screensound great screen great sound ok everybody love fm radio want cell phone first right phone 6610 excels cell phone thank god voice qualityreception voice quality good get great reception place get tmobile coverage good see screencommand color screen make freeafterrebates phone shine bright command responsive button gripe hardware button nokia seems campaign revamp phone keypad imho totally unnecessary key model traditional key arrangement really close one another unconventional shape take big getting used someone like big hand fair said many korean import nokia build quality light year ahead korean phone perfect phone u patience flip tmobile finally reiterate thumbsdown rating tmobile carrier tmobile network coverage sporadic network always seems overloaded resulting unpleasant calling experience get phone cingular att go carrier
"great phone , great service , no voice dialing . 
phone the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is . when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small . 
size after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket . 
earpiece it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included . the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number . 
voice dialing unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming . 
screen when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is . 
resolution, color the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! the phone has several color schemes you can choose from . i like the default blue . you can also set a background wallpaper . 
ringtone the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? no more annoying series of beeps . this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music . 
ring you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call . the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact . 
phone the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection . 
gprs,t-zone the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful . you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks . the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go . 
t-zone one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 . their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported . i have been assured this will be fixed soon . now , for the t-mobile service : i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones . if you have a question , they have the answer . and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick . every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone . 
t-mobile service all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved . i 'd like to see my old carrier do that ! 
rate plan the rate plans are also very good , at least for me . different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive . the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked . 
phone this phone is highly recommended otherwise .","[{'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'size', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'earpiece', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'dialing', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'screen', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'resolution', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'color', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'ringtone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'ring', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'gprs', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 1}, {'feature': 'zone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'zone', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'service', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'plan', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 3}, {'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}]",Nokia Phone,great phone great service voice dialing phone nokia 6610 relatively new phone great phone first saw 6610 thought small size using found size perfect carrying pocket earpiece tad small hold ear shoulder solved comfortable handsfree earpiece included earpiece button answer hangsup phone mess phone unless dialing number voice dialing unfortunately 6610 offer voice dialing like previous phone feature pack outweighs shortcoming screen turned phone first thing hit good screen resolution color resolution good color bright even changeable phone several color scheme choose like default blue also set background wallpaper ringtone ringtones included awesome mention polyphonic annoying series beep phone play 4 tone one time actually sound like music ring also assign special ring graphic special people call massive phonebook hold 300 entry multiple phone number per entry program bos home work cellphone number one contact phone phone also sport image gallery option camera attachment calendar organizer alarm clock snooze fm radio way cool even earpeice game java application gprs highspeed internet connection gprstzone gprs connection sometimes slow writing instant message included aol instant messenger software pain tzones application quite useful get weather movie horoscope click service deafults showing information associated billing zip code change default seach area go tzone one downside writing tmobile nt updated tzone system fully support 6610 website show compatible phone try access game downloads tzones system return error message saying phone supported assured fixed soon tmobile service say enough good thing people answer phone question answer know find pretty quick every phone experience started brief time hold followed cheerful representative answering phone tmobile service question problem quickly satisfactorily resolved like see old carrier rate plan rate plan also good least different people different need course tmobile plan priced well minute service receive phone would received 5 star phone voice dialing game downloads tzones worked phone phone highly recommended otherwise
"t-mobile ruins an otherwise good phone . 
phone nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear . 
menu, feature with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great . 
menu the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have . one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe , etc. yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch . 
internet the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network . therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet . after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone . bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it . find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .","[{'feature': 'phone', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'menu', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'feature', 'polarity': 1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'menu', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}, {'feature': 'internet', 'polarity': -1, 'strength': 2}]",Nokia Phone,tmobile ruin otherwise good phone phone nokia make great phone clear menu feature complicated feature menu easily accessible quality feature great menu one huge disappointment phone manufactured tmobile lack many menu function nokia straight manufacturer one thing tmobile brag fact worldphone used europe etc yet gotten rid language phone including italian german dutch internet internet function phone wap gprs work tmobile service deleted menu option would enable configure phone used different network therefore wanted travel abroad pop local sim card even unlock phone way use local wap browser internet spending hour transferred one tech help person another got fed decided return phone bottom line attracted phone triband feature take abroad forget find another phone buy one manufacturerunlocked form
